                Cleanbot was an attempt to simplify the cleaning of home. It was powered by arduino and had 2 mini mops along with a water tank and pump.
                It could be controlled through an android app. The app connects to the bot via bluetooth to send the user commands.

                Inspite of being pretty ambitious, it was a honorable failure. Latency of bluetooth was the primary reason. You might get a clue if you look at it's casual demo video.
